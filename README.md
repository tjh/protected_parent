protected_parent_of
==============

Stops the deletion of an ActiveRecord object when members of a specified child association exist.

It adds a "removeable?" method to evaluate whether the object may be deleted and the necessary before_destroy callback.

Example Usage
=============

Adding to your models
---------------------

The model 'has_many :posts'. Do not allow deletion if there are Post records associated with this object:
    
    class Category < ActiveRecord::Base
      protected_parent_of :posts
    end
    
If it 'has_one :attachement', don't allow deletion until the attachment has been removed. Use the singular, just like the 'has_one'
    
    class Category < ActiveRecord::Base
      protected_parent_of :attachment
    end
    
If necessary, allow several child objects to stay deletion. For example, a polymorphic category model may have:
    
    class Category < ActiveRecord::Base
      protected_parent_of :posts, :comments
    end
    
Depending on taste, you can call protected_parent_of multiple times:
    
    class Category < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_many :posts
      has_many :comments
      protected_parent_of :posts, :comments
      
      has_one :attachment
      protected_parent_of :attachment
    end
    
When you need something more sophisticated, you can target a method or named_scope. This would block deletion of the category if there were any active posts:

    class Category < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_many :posts
      protected_parent_of :active_posts
      
      def active_posts
        posts.active
      end
    end
    
    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      named_scope :active, :condition => { :active => true }
    end

Using the methods
-----------------

Once applied to a model, protected_parent_of adds several methods to your model. You can now use 'protected?' and 'removable?'

    category = Category.new
    category.protected?                 # False
    category.removable?                 # True

    category = Category.new
    category.posts << Post.create
    category.protected?                 # True
    category.removable?                 # False

And most importantly, it will block deletion

    category = Category.create
    category.posts = Post.create
    category.delete                     # False
    category.delete!                    # Raises an exception
